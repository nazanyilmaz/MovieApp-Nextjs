<h1>MovieApp-Nextjs/h1> 
<p>
I developed a MovieApp using React and Next.Js features. We included movies in 3 different categories into the project by sending a request to TMDB-Api. When you click on the movie, you can access the movie details. You can search for movies using SearcBar.</p>
 <p> React-Next.JS-Tailwind-React.Icons-Next-themes packages were used. /p>
